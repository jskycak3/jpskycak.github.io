## [Selected](#selected)

I've done research in physics, neuroscience, math, and business. The projects I’m most proud of in each phase are in bold. Here are some of my favorites!

2017 | <font color="green">The Data Scientist's Guide to Topological Data Analysis</font> | Advisors: Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics) | Wrote an honors bachelor's thesis explaining the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrating its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">(manuscript)</a></font>  
2016 | <font color="green">Code Profiles of Activity Clusters</font> | Advisor: Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics) | Generated a hierarchical clustering visualization of consumer service usage for a banking client, which led to the discovery of a sales funnel. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-salesfunnel.pdf">(slide)</a></font>  
2014 | <font color="green">Optimizing Scintillation and Light Transmission for Use in a High Energy Particle Detector</font> | Advisors: Dan Karmgard, Mark Vigneault (Notre Dame) | Improved data transmission in a light-based particle detector by finding the optimal pair of light-producing and light-propagating materials. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector.pdf">(poster)</a></font>

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether I want to return to data science in industry, or take on a PhD and move towards data science research / teaching in academia.  

In Progress | <font color="green">Programmable Self-Assembly into Non-Simply-Connected Shapes</font> | | Improving upon the self-assembly algorithm presented by Rubenstein, Cornejo, and Nagpal in the paper <i>Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm</i>. Extending their algorithm to work on non-simply-connected shapes, i.e. those having holes or cutouts.  
In Progress | <font color="green">Intuiting Algorithms in Supervised Machine Learning</font> | | Explained how various algorithms in supervised machine learning function and relate to each other, to an audience who is familiar with the algorithms but does not yet intuit their underlying math and see how they fit together. <font color="blue"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHOIYDTrnJjwUFwhhHZL6YvMKHQLf9djOsTi3CXzm2g/edit?usp=sharing">(draft)</a></font>

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I also worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. My work was split between
1. production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn),
2. exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and
3. R&D (topological data analysis).  

2018 | <font color="green">360Giving Challenge</font> | Independent viz for threesixtygiving.org | Classified grants into high-level themes based on titles and descriptions, and used animated scatter plots to show which donors funded which themes throughout the years. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/360Giving-Challenge">(site)</a></font>  
2017 | <b><font color="green">The Data Scientist's Guide to Topological Data Analysis</font></b> | Advisors: Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics) | Wrote an honors bachelor's thesis explaining the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrating its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data. Gave a talk for the honors program. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">(manuscript)</a></font> <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk.pdf">(slides)</a></font>  
2017 | <font color="green">Data Science Case Study: Visualizing Reddit Data</font> | Independent R&D at Aunalytics | Presented a case-study of using topological data analysis to visualize Reddit data. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit.pdf">(slides)</a></font>  
2016 | <font color="green">Topological Data Analysis: Theory, Practice, Software, and Potential</font> | Independent R&D at Aunalytics | Gave a talk explaining the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrating its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-tda.pdf">(slides)</a></font>

## [Undergrad](#undergrad)

<i>2014-17.</i> As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I made a few documents for math tutoring which you can find on my <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/tutoring/#bio">tutoring page</a></font>. I also made educational articles on neuroscience and computers, which are listed below.

2015 | <b><font color="green">Computers, for the Confused</font></b> | Explained how computers work in simple terms, from circuitry to the internet. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-computers_confused.pdf">(article)</a></font>  
2015 | <b><font color="green">A Single-Sentence Snapshot of the Brain</font></b> | Explained how computer. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-snapshot_brain.pdf">(article)</a></font>

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether I want to return to data science in industry, or take on a PhD and move towards data science research / teaching in academia.  

In Progress | <font color="green">Intuiting Algorithms in Supervised Machine Learning</font> | Explained how various algorithms in supervised machine learning function and relate to each other, to an audience who is familiar with the algorithms but does not yet intuit their underlying math and see how they fit together. <font color="blue"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zHOIYDTrnJjwUFwhhHZL6YvMKHQLf9djOsTi3CXzm2g/edit?usp=sharing">(draft)</a></font>

## [Undergrad](#undergrad)

<i>2014-18.</i> As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I made a few documents for math tutoring which you can find on my <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/tutoring/#bio">tutoring page</a></font>. I also made educational articles on neuroscience and computers, which are listed below.

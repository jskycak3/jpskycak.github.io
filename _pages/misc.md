| <b><font color="black">360Giving Challenge</font> (2018)</b><br> Visualized which donors funded which themes throughout the years. (This also required classifying grants into high-level themes based on titles and descriptions.)<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/360Giving-Challenge">site</a>, <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jpskycak/360Giving-Challenge/blob/master/360giving.ipynb">code</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> This is a visualization of which donors funded which themes throughout the years. The given dataset consisted of grant records and included donors/recipients, dates/amounts, and titles/descriptions. First, I tagged grants into themes according to keywords in the title and description. Then, for each theme in each year, I computed each donor's average grant amount, total giving, and total giving in that theme as a percent of the donor's total giving in all themes. I visualized the results in an animated dot plot for each theme.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-360giving_challenge-img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of dot plot"></center></details> |

The method was based on a quantity I called the "discrepancy fraction," which is given by<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-pairwise_relationship_analysis_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 10%;" alt="discrepancy fraction formula"></center><br> and which appears in many standard statistical quantities such as chi-squared and mutual information. I also built a Shiny app prototype of a tool that would use the discrepancy fraction to help analysts sort through all the relationships between features in a dataset. <br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-pairwise_relationship_analysis_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="app input"></center><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-pairwise_relationship_analysis_img03.png" style="border: none; width: 90%;" alt="app display"></center></details> |

| <b><font color="black">End-of-Summer 2015 Report</font> (2015)</b><br> Implemented spiking neurons in a deep neural network, in attempt to emulate brain waves.<br> <details><br> <b>Advisor:</b> Garrett Kenyon (Los Alamos National Lab)<br><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-lanl.pdf">work summary</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> The goal of my summer project was to implement spiking neurons and observe "brain oscillations" in an open-source deep learning framework called Petavision. To implement spiking neurons, I had neurons inhibit themselves, so that they would reset whenever they became active.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-lanl_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of spiking neuron"></center><br> However, I did not observe any oscillations in spike rates, and the network performed poorly on image reconstruction tasks, likely because the training algorithm was tailored to non-spiking neurons. It was beyond the scope and duration of the project to create a new training algorithm tailored to spiking neurons.</details> |  

| <b><font color="black">Wixtend: the Free Online Thinktank</font> (2015)</b><br> Prototyped a wiki site where students could collaborate on academic projects.<br> <details><br> <b>Videos:</b><br> <video src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-wixtend_overview.mp4" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video><br> <video src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-wixtend_tutorial.mp4" width="320" height="200" controls preload></video><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> The goal of this project was to create a collaborative project website where users could host their own projects and contribute to projects hosted by other users. I designed the site as a MediaWiki wiki so that individual users' contributions to a project could be tracked precisely: potential collaborators would submit edits to projects, project hosts would decide whether or not to approve the edits, and every submission and approval would be written into the logs. After the initial prototype, the project was ended in favor of using GitHub.</details> |

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether I want to return to data science in industry, or take on a PhD in computational biology.  

In Progress | <font color="green">Programmable Self-Assembly into Any Shape of 2 or 3 Dimensions</font> | | Extending the self-assembly algorithm presented by Rubenstein et al. in the paper <i>Programmable self-assembly in a thousand-robot swarm</i>.

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I also worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. My work was split between
1. production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn),
2. exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and
3. R&D (topological data analysis).

## [Undergrad](#undergrad)

<i>2014-18.</i> As an undergrad at Notre Dame, I used simulation and numerical methods to explore problems in neuroscience and math. My honors thesis research drew heavily on my work experience as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company, so it's included in the <i>Consulting</i> section above.  

2016 | <b><font color="green">Topological Consequences of STDP in Neuronal Networks</font></b> | Advisor: Dervis Can Vural (Notre Dame) | Began laying mathematical foundations for previous neural simulation results.

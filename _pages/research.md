I've done research in physics, math, neuroscience, and business. The projects I’m most proud of are starred (☆); of these, the big projects are labeled with a filled-in star (★).

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether to return to data science or take on a PhD in computational biology.

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. My work was split between
1. production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn),
2. exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and
3. R&D (topological data analysis).

## [Precollege](#precollege)

<i>2013-14.</i> I got my feet wet in physics research as a high-schooler, working on projects at IU South Bend and Notre Dame.  

| <b>★ <font color="green">Optimizing Scintillation and Light Transmission for Use in a High Energy Particle Detector</font> (2014; <font size="2" color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector.pdf">poster</a></font>)</b><br> Improved data transmission in a light-based particle detector by finding the optimal pair of light-producing and light-propagating materials.<br> <font size="2"><details><br> <u>Advisors</u>: Dan Karmgard, Mark Vigneault (Notre Dame)<br><br> <u>Collaborator</u>: Andrew Henderson (assisted in data collection)<br><br> <u>Presented at</u>: Indiana Junior Science and Humanities Symposium 2014, Northern Indiana Regional Science/Engineering Fair 2014<br><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector is a general-purpose particle detector located on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. It gathers particle collision data in the form of light: particle sprays pass through scintillating tiles lining the interior of the detector, causing the tiles to emit light, which is then wavelength-shifted and sent to the data processing center via fiber optic cables.<br><br> The goal of my project was to find the optimal pair of scintillating and wavelength-shifting plastics, to be replaced during the detector upgrade. Using a small radioactive source in a light-tight box, I collected a light output intensity histogram for each pair of scintillating and wavelength-shifting plastics, and found a pair which outperformed the pair previously used in the detector. I also found an optimal pairing for long optical fiber arrangements, where minimizing light attenuation becomes more important than maximizing light generation.</details></font> |  

| <b>★ <font color="green">Making a Matching Layer for Acoustic Sensors for a COUPP Dark Matter Detector</font> (2013; <font size="2" color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector.pdf">poster</a></font>)</b><br> Improved data transmission in a sound-based particle detector by creating a sound-absorbing material.<br> <font size="2"><details><br> <u>Advisor</u>: Ilan Levine (IU South Bend)<br><br> <u>Presented at</u>: Indiana Junior Science and Humanities Symposium 2013, Northern Indiana Regional Science/Engineering Fair 2013, Hoosier Science/Engineering Fair 2013, Intel International Science/Engineering Fair 2013, Indiana Academy of Science Talent Search 2013<br><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> The COUPP experiment at Fermilab attempts to detect dark matter by analyzing the sound of collisions in a superheated liquid. When a particle whizzing through the air collides with a particle of the liquid, the energy from the collision creates a bubble in the liquid, and the superheated temperature of the liquid allows the bubble to greatly expand. The formation and expansion of the bubble sends sound waves throughout the liquid, which are picked up by sound sensors attached to the container in which the liquid resides. Each particle has its own “bubble sound” fingerprint, and the sound data can be used to identify the type of particle involved in the collision.<br><br> The goal of my project was to create an intermediate material to put between the container and the sensors, that would increase sound transmission by better matching the "acoustic impedances" of the container and sensor and thus reducing the amount of reflected sound. I engineered a material with the correct acoustic impedance by mixing together varying amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy, and it unexpectedly damped the sound signal rather than amplifying it, possibly due to density fluctuations within the mixture. However, the sound-damping material still found use as a backing layer on the sensors, where it improved sound transmission by reducing excess vibrations and ringing within the sensors.</details></font> |

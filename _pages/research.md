## [Bio](#bio)

I got my feet wet in physics research as a high-schooler, contributing to projects at IU South Bend and Notre Dame. As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I worked on projects in math and computational neuroscience, and as an as an underclassman, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. At Aunalytics, I built production models to predict customer churn, mined business datasets for open-ended actionable insights, and taught/demonstrated new technology such as topological data analysis. Now, I'm pursuing a MS in computer science through Georgia Tech. In particular, I'm working on designing algorithms to solve structural puzzles.

The projects I’m most proud of are in <b><font color="green">green</font></b>.

TDA is attractive yet elusive for most data scientists, since its potential as a data exploration tool is often communicated through esoteric terminology unfamiliar to non-mathematicians. The purpose of this guide is to bridge the communication gap between academia and industry, so that non-mathematician data scientists may add current TDA methods to their analytic toolkits and anticipate new developments in the field of TDA.<br><br> The guide begins with an overview of Mapper, a TDA algorithm which has recently transitioned from academia to industry with commercial success. We explain the Mapper algorithm, demo open-source software, and present a handful of its commercial use-cases (some of which are original).<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of mapper algorithm"></center><br> Then, we switch to persistent homology, a TDA method which has not yet broken through to industry but is supported by a growing body of academic work. We explain the intuition behind homotopy, approximation, homology, and persistence, and demo open-source persistent homology software.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of homology"></center><br> It is hoped that the data scientist reading this guide will be inspired to give Mapper a try in their future analytic work, and be on the lookout for future developments in persistent homology that push it from academia to industry.</details> |

First, I used the balances, transaction frequencies, and total cash flows of the accounts to cluster the accounts into 4 levels of health: high-activity accounts, medium-activity accounts, low-activity accounts, and accounts at risk of churn. Then, for each cluster, I created a heatmap to display the fraction of accounts that used each service. <br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-salesfunnel_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of heatmap hierarchy"></center><br> Laid side by side, the heatmaps revealed a hierarchy in transaction types: accounts at risk of closing tended to use only deposits/interest, low-activity accounts additionally used check/credit/debit, medium-activity accounts additionally used ATM/point-of-sale, and high-activity accounts additionally used fees and transfer credit/debit. This hierarchy could be interpreted as a sales funnel, telling which particular services could be pushed on a customer in attempt to nudge their account toward a level of activity.<br><br> I also looked for telltale signs in account activity preceding churns. Since I was not able to find any through manual search nor visual inspection, we turned to machine learning for churn prediction.</details> |

Agents choose a number of social connections to keep, and have a payoff function that depends on two competing factors: the number of connections and the probability of remaining healthy. Health officials advise agents to keep a particular number of connections that would maximize everyone's expected payoff if everyone kept that number of connections. In the absence of advice, it is assumed that agents maximize their expected payoff in the worst case, when every neighbor who is not immune becomes infected.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-gametheory_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of game setup"></center><br> I found that following social distancing advice always allowed agents to keep several connections while maintaining a payoff, wherease in the absence of social distancing advice, agents would nearly or fully isolate themselves and even then could expect a payoff only a fraction the size of that under social distancing advice.</details> |

If it is even, divide by 2; if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Do it again, and again, and so on -- for example: 3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1. The 3n+1 problem is to prove that no matter what number you start with, you will eventually reach 1. At surface-level it seems like there should be a simple solution, but it has remained unsolved for over 70 years and is thought by some mathematicians to require the use of mathematics far beyond that of our present knowledge.<br><br> In this project, I extended the 3n+1 problem to the set of real numbers using a continuous sinusoidal function which maps every even number to half of itself, and every odd number to one more than three times itself.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-scientia_preprint_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of function"></center><br> Repeated application of this function appeared to eventually map every real number to the interval [1,2] -- however, and quite interestingly, iteration sequences often differed wildly for input numbers seemingly very close together.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-scientia_preprint_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of sequences"></center><br> I also generalized the 3n+1 problem to the an+b problem and found that the decreasing end-behavior tends to break just above a=3, which is surprising because if the numbers in an iteration sequence have equal chance of being even or odd, then the cutoff should not be until a=4. However, by comparing the increasing vs decreasing area in the continuous version of the an+b problem, I was able to justify the a=3 cutoff.</details> |

It gathers particle collision data in the form of light: particle sprays pass through scintillating tiles lining the interior of the detector, causing the tiles to emit light, which is then wavelength-shifted and sent to the data processing center via fiber optic cables.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 66%;" alt="image of detector"></center><br> The goal of my project was to find the optimal pair of scintillating and wavelength-shifting plastics, to be replaced during the detector upgrade.

When a particle whizzing through the air collides with a particle of the liquid, the energy from the collision creates a bubble in the liquid, and the superheated temperature of the liquid allows the bubble to greatly expand. The formation and expansion of the bubble sends sound waves throughout the liquid, which are picked up by sound sensors attached to the container in which the liquid resides. Each particle has its own “bubble sound” fingerprint, and the sound data can be used to identify the type of particle involved in the collision.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of detector"></center><br> The goal of my project was to create an intermediate material to put between the container and the sensors, that would increase sound transmission by better matching the "acoustic impedances" of the container and sensor and thus reducing the amount of reflected sound. I engineered a material with the correct acoustic impedance by mixing together varying amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy, and it unexpectedly damped the sound signal rather than amplifying it, possibly due to density fluctuations within the mixture.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of signal"></center><br> However, the sound-damping material still found use as a backing layer on the sensors, where it improved sound transmission by reducing excess vibrations and ringing within the sensors.</details> |

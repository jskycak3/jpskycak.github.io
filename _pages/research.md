| <b><font color="green">★ The Data Scientist's Guide to Topological Data Analysis</font> (2017; <font size="2" color="blue"><a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">thesis</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk.pdf">slides</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-tda.pdf">slides from earlier talk</a></font>)</b><br> Explained the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrated its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data.<br> <details><br> <u>Advisors</u>: Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics)<br><br> <u>Presented at</u>: Aunalytics, Glynn Honors Program at Notre Dame<br><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> Topological Data Analysis, abbreviated TDA, is a suite of data analytic methods inspired by the mathematical field of algebraic topology. TDA is attractive yet elusive for most data scientists, since its potential as a data exploration tool is often communicated through esoteric terminology unfamiliar to non-mathematicians. The purpose of this guide is to bridge the communication gap between academia and industry, so that non-mathematician data scientists may add current TDA methods to their analytic toolkits and anticipate new developments in the field of TDA.<br><br> The guide begins with an overview of Mapper, a TDA algorithm which has recently transitioned from academia to industry with commercial success. We explain the Mapper algorithm, demo open-source software, and present a handful of its commercial use-cases (some of which are original).<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of mapper algorithm"></center><br> Then, we switch to persistent homology, a TDA method which has not yet broken through to industry but is supported by a growing body of academic work. We explain the intuition behind homotopy, approximation, homology, and persistence, and demo open-source persistent homology software.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of homology"></center><br> It is hoped that the data scientist reading this guide will be inspired to give Mapper a try in their future analytic work, and be on the lookout for future developments in persistent homology that push it from academia to industry.</details> |

Agents choose a number of social connections to keep, and have a payoff function that depends on two competing factors: the number of connections and the probability of remaining healthy. Health officials advise agents to keep a particular number of connections that would maximize everyone's expected payoff if everyone kept that number of connections. In the absence of advice, it is assumed that agents maximize their expected payoff in the worst case, when every neighbor who is not immune becomes infected. I found that following social distancing advice always allowed agents to keep several connections while maintaining a payoff, wherease in the absence of social distancing advice, agents would enarly of fully isolate themselves and even then could expect a payoff only a fraction the size of that under social distancing advice.</details> |

The 3n+1 problem is to prove that no matter what number you start with, you will eventually reach 1.

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether to return to data science or take on a PhD in computational biology.  

| <b><font color="black">Shaping STDP Neural Networks with Periodic Stimulation: a Theoretical Analysis for the Case of Tree Networks</font> (2018; <font size="2" color="blue"><a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-shaping_stdp_neural_networks_with_periodic_stimulation.pdf">writeup</a></font>)</b><br> Solved a special case of how to periodically stimulate a neural network to obtain a desired connectivity.<br> <details><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> The goal of this project was to create a simple neural network model with a biologically realistic learning rule, whose changes in connectivity could be derived analytically. After creating the model, I derived rules for how periodic stimulation of a single neuron would change the connectivity of the network, in the case of a tree network. Then, I used those rules to come up wth two-neuron stimulation patterns to solidify or break connections in the tree as desired.</details> |

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. My work was split between
1. production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn),
2. exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and
3. R&D (topological data analysis).

(This also required classifying grants into high-level themes based on titles and descriptions.)<br> <details><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> This is a visualization of which donors funded which themes throughout the years. The given dataset consisted of grant records and included donors/recipients, dates/amounts, and titles/descriptions. First, I tagged grants into themes according to keywords in the title and description. Then, for each theme in each year, I computed each donor's average grant amount, total giving, and total giving in that theme as a percent of the donor's total giving in all themes. I visualized the results in an animated dot plot for each theme.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-360giving_challenge-img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of dot plot"></center></details> |

It gathers particle collision data in the form of light: particle sprays pass through scintillating tiles lining the interior of the detector, causing the tiles to emit light, which is then wavelength-shifted and sent to the data processing center via fiber optic cables.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 66%;" alt="image of detector"></center><br> The goal of my project was to find the optimal pair of scintillating and wavelength-shifting plastics, to be replaced during the detector upgrade. Using a small radioactive source in a light-tight box, I collected a light output intensity histogram for each pair of scintillating and wavelength-shifting plastics, and found a pair which outperformed the pair previously used in the detector.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 66%;" alt="image of radioactive source"></center><br> I also found an optimal pairing for long optical fiber arrangements, where minimizing light attenuation becomes more important than maximizing light generation.</details> |

When a particle whizzing through the air collides with a particle of the liquid, the energy from the collision creates a bubble in the liquid, and the superheated temperature of the liquid allows the bubble to greatly expand. The formation and expansion of the bubble sends sound waves throughout the liquid, which are picked up by sound sensors attached to the container in which the liquid resides. Each particle has its own “bubble sound” fingerprint, and the sound data can be used to identify the type of particle involved in the collision.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of detector"></center><br> The goal of my project was to create an intermediate material to put between the container and the sensors, that would increase sound transmission by better matching the "acoustic impedances" of the container and sensor and thus reducing the amount of reflected sound. I engineered a material with the correct acoustic impedance by mixing together varying amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy, and it unexpectedly damped the sound signal rather than amplifying it, possibly due to density fluctuations within the mixture.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of signal"></center><br> However, the sound-damping material still found use as a backing layer on the sensors, where it improved sound transmission by reducing excess vibrations and ringing within the sensors.</details> |

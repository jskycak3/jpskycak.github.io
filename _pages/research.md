I've done research in physics, neuroscience, math, and business.

<b>Selected Projects</b>

2017 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame, Aunalytics</font> | Wrote an honors bachelor's thesis explaining the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrating its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data. Advisors: Mark Behrens, Dave Cieslak. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">(manuscript)</a></font>  
2016 | <font color="green">Aunalytics</font> | Generated a hierarchical clustering visualization of consumer service usage for a banking client, which led to the discovery of a sales funnel. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-salesfunnel.pdf">(slide)</a></font>  
2014 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame</font> | Improved data transmission in a light-based particle detector by finding the optimal pair of light-producing and light-propagating materials. Advisors: Dan Karmgard, Mark Vigneault. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-particledetector.pdf">(poster)</a></font>

<b>Masters Research (2018-2020)</b>

I'm doing a master's through Georgia Tech. Classes/projects begin in August!  

<b>Industry Data Science (2016-2018)</b>

As an upperclassman at ND, I also worked full-time as a data scientist at a nearby company called Aunalytics. My work was split between production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn), exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and R&D (topological data analysis).  

2018 | <font color="green">360Giving Challenge</font> | Classified grants into high-level themes based on titles and descriptions, and used animated scatter plots to show which donors funded which themes throughout the years. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/360Giving-Challenge">(site)</a></font>

2017 | <font color="green">Aunalytics</font> | Presented a case-study of using topological data analysis to visualize Reddit data. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit.pdf">(slides)</a></font>  
2016 | <font color="green">Aunalytics</font> | Gave a talk explaining the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrating its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-tda.pdf">(slides)</a></font>

<b>Undergraduate Research (2013-2016)</b>

I got my feet wet in physics research as a high-schooler, working on projects at IUSB and ND. As an underclassman at ND, I used simulation and numerical methods to explore problems in neuroscience and math.  

2016 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame</font> | Began laying mathematical foundations for the simulation results of 2015. Solved a special case, but the project was cut short when I took an industry job in data science. Advisor: Dervis Can Vural. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-stdp2.pdf">(unfinished writeup)</a></font>  
2016 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame</font> | For a final project, used game theory to analyze the effectiveness of social distancing advice in epidemics. Course Instructor: Vijay Gupta. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-gametheory.pdf">(writeup)</a></font>  
2015 | <font color="green">Los Alamos National Lab</font> | Implemented spiking neurons in a deep neural network, in attempt to emulate brain waves. Advisor: Garrett Kenyon. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-lanl.pdf">(work summary)</a></font>  
2015 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame</font> | Conducted numerical experiments on an open problem in mathematics. Advisor: Jeff Diller. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-scientia.pdf">(article)</a></font>  
2015 | <font color="green">University of Notre Dame</font> | Gave a talk presenting simulation results of how cyclic neuronal networks ought to change, under a particular theory of neural plasticity, in response to periodic stimulation. Advisor: Dervis Can Vural. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-stdp.pdf">(slides)</a></font>

2013 | <font color="green">Indiana University South Bend</font> | Improved data transmission in a sound-based particle detector by creating a sound-absorbing material. Advisor: Ilan Levine. <font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector.pdf">(poster)</a></font>

I've done research in physics, math, neuroscience, and business. The projects I’m most proud of are in bold.

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'll decide by Fall 2019 whether to return to data science or take on a PhD in computational biology.

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. My work was split between
1. production models (such as a random forest to predict customer churn),
2. exploratory analyses (one of which resulted in the discovery of a sales funnel for a banking client), and
3. R&D (topological data analysis).

## [Precollege](#precollege)

<i>2013-14.</i> I got my feet wet in physics research as a high-schooler, working on projects at IU South Bend and Notre Dame.

When a particle whizzing through the air collides with a particle of the liquid, the energy from the collision creates a bubble in the liquid, and the superheated temperature of the liquid allows the bubble to greatly expand. The formation and expansion of the bubble sends sound waves throughout the liquid, which are picked up by sound sensors attached to the container in which the liquid resides. Each particle has its own “bubble sound” fingerprint, and the sound data can be used to identify the type of particle involved in the collision.<br><br> The goal of my project was to create an intermediate material to put between the container and the sensors, that would increase sound transmission by better matching the "acoustic impedances" of the container and sensor and thus reducing the amount of reflected sound. I engineered a material with the correct acoustic impedance by mixing together varying amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy, and it unexpectedly damped the sound signal rather than amplifying it, possibly due to density fluctuations within the mixture. However, the sound-damping material still found use as a backing layer on the sensors, where it improved sound transmission by reducing excess vibrations and ringing within the sensors.</details></font> |

Hi! My name is Justin, and Iâ€™m an incoming student in Georgia Tech's MS in Computer Science. I worked 2 years at a data science startup while studying a BS in Math, and I'm focusing on furthering my education and experience in the field of data visualization. I also tutor math and test prep and produce music.

## [Bio](#bio)

I got my feet wet in physics research as a high-schooler, contributing to projects at IU South Bend and Notre Dame. As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I worked on projects in math and computational neuroscience; as an as an upperclassman, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company. I'm currently working on a MS in computer science through Georgia Tech, and am interested in applying predictive analytics to electronic health records.

This hierarchy could be interpreted as a sales funnel, telling which particular services could be pushed on a customer in attempt to nudge their account toward a level of activity.<br><br> I also looked for telltale signs in account activity preceding churns.

If it is even, divide by 2; if it is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1. Do it again, and again, and so on -- for example: 3,10,5,16,8,4,2,1. The 3n+1 problem is to prove that no matter what number you start with, you will eventually reach 1. At surface-level it seems like there should be a simple solution, but it has remained unsolved for over 70 years and is thought by some mathematicians to require the use of mathematics far beyond that of our present knowledge.<br><br> In this project, I extended the 3n+1 problem to the set of real numbers using a continuous sinusoidal function which maps every even number to half of itself, and every odd number to one more than three times itself.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-scientia_preprint_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of function"></center><br> Repeated application of this function appeared to eventually map every real number to the interval [1,2] -- however, and quite interestingly, iteration sequences often differed wildly for input numbers seemingly very close together.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-scientia_preprint_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of sequences"></center><br> I also generalized the 3n+1 problem to the an+b problem and found that the decreasing end-behavior tends to break just above a=3, which is surprising because if the numbers in an iteration sequence have equal chance of being even or odd, then the cutoff should not be until a=4. However, by comparing the increasing vs decreasing area in the continuous version of the an+b problem, I was able to justify the a=3 cutoff.</details></td></tr></table>

When a particle whizzing through the air collides with a particle of the liquid, the energy from the collision creates a bubble in the liquid, and the superheated temperature of the liquid allows the bubble to greatly expand. The formation and expansion of the bubble sends sound waves throughout the liquid, which are picked up by sound sensors attached to the container in which the liquid resides. Each particle has its own “bubble sound” fingerprint, and the sound data can be used to identify the type of particle involved in the collision.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of detector"></center><br> The goal of my project was to create an intermediate material to put between the container and the sensors, that would increase sound transmission by better matching the "acoustic impedances" of the container and sensor and thus reducing the amount of reflected sound. I engineered a material with the correct acoustic impedance by mixing together varying amounts of tungsten powder and epoxy, and it unexpectedly damped the sound signal rather than amplifying it, possibly due to density fluctuations within the mixture.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-iusb-particledetector_img02.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="image of signal"></center><br> However, the sound-damping material still found use as a backing layer on the sensors, where it improved sound transmission by reducing excess vibrations and ringing within the sensors.</details></td></tr></table>

TDA is attractive yet elusive for most data scientists, since its potential as a data exploration tool is often communicated through esoteric terminology unfamiliar to non-mathematicians. The purpose of this guide is to bridge the communication gap between academia and industry, so that non-mathematician data scientists may add current TDA methods to their analytic toolkits and anticipate new developments in the field of TDA.<br><br> The guide begins with an overview of Mapper, a TDA algorithm which has recently transitioned from academia to industry with commercial success. We explain the Mapper algorithm, demo open-source software, and present a handful of its commercial use-cases (some of which are original).<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of mapper algorithm"></center><br> Then, we switch to persistent homology, a TDA method which has not yet broken through to industry but is supported by a growing body of academic work. We explain the intuition behind homotopy, approximation, homology, and persistence, and demo open-source persistent homology software.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of homology"></center><br> It is hoped that the data scientist reading this guide will be inspired to give Mapper a try in their future analytic work, and be on the lookout for future developments in persistent homology that push it from academia to industry.</details></td></tr></table>

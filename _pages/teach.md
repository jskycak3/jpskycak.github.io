The projects I’m most proud of are in <b><font color="green">green</font></b>, and the big projects which required substantial effort are labeled with a star (★).

## [Master's](#masters)

<i>2018-20.</i> I'm doing a master's in computer science through Georgia Tech OMSCS. Classes/projects begin in August 2018! I'm hoping to TA next semester.

## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. Some of my R&D work on Topological Data Analysis also served an educational purpose.

| <b><font color="green">★ The Data Scientist's Guide to Topological Data Analysis</font> (2017; <font size="2" color="blue"><a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">thesis</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk.pdf">slides</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-tda.pdf">slides from earlier talk</a></font>)</b><br> Explained the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrated its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data.<br> <details><br> <u>Advisors</u>: Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics)<br><br> <u>Presented at</u>: Aunalytics, Glynn Honors Program at Notre Dame<br><br> <u>Summary:</u><br> Topological Data Analysis, abbreviated TDA, is a suite of data analytic methods inspired by the mathematical field of algebraic topology. TDA is attractive yet elusive for most data scientists, since its potential as a data exploration tool is often communicated through esoteric terminology unfamiliar to non-mathematicians. The purpose of this guide is to bridge the communication gap between academia and industry, so that non-mathematician data scientists may add current TDA methods to their analytic toolkits and anticipate new developments in the field of TDA.<br><br> The guide begins with an overview of Mapper, a TDA algorithm which has recently transitioned from academia to industry with commercial success. We explain the Mapper algorithm, demo open-source software, and present a handful of its commercial use-cases (some of which are original).<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of mapper algorithm"></center><br> Then, we switch to persistent homology, a TDA method which has not yet broken through to industry but is supported by a growing body of academic work. We explain the intuition behind homotopy, approximation, homology, and persistence, and demo open-source persistent homology software.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of homology"></center><br> It is hoped that the data scientist reading this guide will be inspired to give Mapper a try in their future analytic work, and be on the lookout for future developments in persistent homology that push it from academia to industry.</details> |

## [Undergrad](#undergrad)

<i>2014-18.</i> As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I made packets for math tutoring, wrote articles on the basics of neuroscience and computers, and created expository writeups for advanced concepts in pure math.

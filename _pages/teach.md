## [Consulting](#consulting)

<i>2016-18.</i> As an upperclassman at Notre Dame, I simultaneously worked full-time as a data scientist at a local analytics consulting company called Aunalytics. Some of my R&D work on Topological Data Analysis also served an educational purpose.

| <b><font color="green">☍ The Data Scientist's Guide to Topological Data Analysis</font> (2017)</b><br> Explained the basic theory behind topological data analysis and demonstrated its applications in visualizing high-dimensional data.<br> <details><br> <b>Advisors:</b> Mark Behrens (Notre Dame), Dave Cieslak (Aunalytics)<br><br> <b>Presented at:</b> Aunalytics, Glynn Honors Program at Notre Dame<br><br> <b>Links</b>: <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis.pdf">thesis</a>, <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk.pdf">slides</a>, <a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-tda.pdf">slides from earlier talk</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> Topological Data Analysis, abbreviated TDA, is a suite of data analytic methods inspired by the mathematical field of algebraic topology. TDA is attractive yet elusive for most data scientists, since its potential as a data exploration tool is often communicated through esoteric terminology unfamiliar to non-mathematicians. The purpose of this guide is to bridge the communication gap between academia and industry, so that non-mathematician data scientists may add current TDA methods to their analytic toolkits and anticipate new developments in the field of TDA.<br><br> The guide begins with an overview of Mapper, a TDA algorithm which has recently transitioned from academia to industry with commercial success. We explain the Mapper algorithm, demo open-source software, and present a handful of its commercial use-cases (some of which are original).<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-aunalytics-reddit_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of mapper algorithm"></center><br> Then, we switch to persistent homology, a TDA method which has not yet broken through to industry but is supported by a growing body of academic work. We explain the intuition behind homotopy, approximation, homology, and persistence, and demo open-source persistent homology software.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-tdathesis_talk_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of homology"></center><br> It is hoped that the data scientist reading this guide will be inspired to give Mapper a try in their future analytic work, and be on the lookout for future developments in persistent homology that push it from academia to industry.</details> |

## [Undergrad](#undergrad)

<i>2014-18.</i> As an underclassman at Notre Dame, I wrote lesson packets for math tutoring, expository writeups for advanced concepts in pure math, and articles on the basics of neuroscience and computers.

| <b><font color="black">Connecting Calculus to the Real World</font> (2017)</b><br> Showed how calculus connects not only to science, technology, and engineering; but also to history, philosophy, business, art, and athletics.<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_connections.pdf">packet</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> Calculus is much more fun to learn when we see how it connects to the real world -- and not just STEM subjects, but also business, athletics, and the liberal arts. Even string art has ties to calculus!<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_connections_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of derivative analogy"></center></details> |  

| <b><font color="black">An Intuitive Primer on Calculus</font> (2017)</b><br> Wrote an introductory lesson to build intuition behind core concepts in calculus.<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_primer.pdf">packet</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> This primer explains the intuition behind the core concepts which tie together all of single-variable calculus, using many analogies and visual aids. Understanding these core concepts makes it to understand the technical details of calculus later on, because one can then see where they fit in the big picture of calculus.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_primer_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 33%;" alt="image of derivative analogy"></center></details> | 

| <b><font color="black">A Visual, Inductive Proof of Sharkovsky's Theorem</font> (2015)</b><br> Presented a friendlier version of a complicated proof in dynamical systems, using extensive visual diagrams.<br> <details><br> <b>Advisor:</b> Jeff Diller (Notre Dame)<br><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-sharkovsky.pdf">writeup</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> Dynamical systems are objects whose states change over time according to an update function. It is often useful to know about the periodicity of points in the system as they are iterated by the update function -- for example, equilibrium states are points with period 1, and other periods can reflect predictable state cycles. In this writeup, I present and visually illustrate a known proof of Sharkovsky's Theorem, which tells us the order of periods of periodic points.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-sharkovsky_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 75%;" alt="image of theorem"></center></details> |  

| <b><font color="black">A Proof of the Skolem-Noether Theorem for Quaternions</font> (2015)</b><br> Presented background and applications of quaternions, including a famous result.<br> <details><br> <b>Advisor:</b> Frank Connolly (Notre Dame)<br><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-quaternions.pdf">writeup</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> We begin with a historical background of Hamilton’s quaternions and a review of their defining properties. We show that the quaternions form an algebra, and we prove the Skolem-Noether theorem for pure quaternions.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/skycak-nd-quaternions_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 66%;" alt="image of theorem"></center><br> We show that the result of the theorem gives physical meaning to automorphisms of pure quaternions. Lastly, we present an application of quaternions to number theory.</details> |  

| <b><font color="black">Computers, for the Confused</font> (2015)</b><br> Explained the basics of how computers work, from circuitry to the internet.<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-computers_confused.pdf">article</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> In this article, we learn - in simple terms - how computers work. Rather than focusing on the nitty-gritty details and countless acronyms, we take a bird’s-eye view as we soar from circuitry to the internet. We also structure our journey in a problem/solution approach so that we understand why things are the way they are in the world of computers.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-computers_confused_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 50%;" alt="computer diagram"></center></details> |  

| <b><font color="black">The Brain in One Sentence</font> (2015)</b><br> Explained the basic functional principles of how the brain computes.<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><font size="2"><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-brain_sentence.pdf">article</a></font></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> In this article, we summarize the brain in a single sentence. At first, the sentence seems like gibberish, but throughout the article we build up our knowledge base so that we can build up our understanding of the sentence. Then, we can remember all the main ideas in the article by remembering the sentence, which now makes good sense to us.<br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-brain_sentence_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 40%;" alt="image of sentence"></center></details> |  

| <b><font color="green">The Physics Behind an Egg Drop: A Lively Story</font> (2014)</b><br> Explained the math and physics behind an egg drop experiment for a student who was interested in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>.<br> <details><br> <b>Link:</b> <i><a class="body" target="_blank" href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-ian.pdf">packet</a></i><br><br> <b>Summary:</b><br> While being chased by a troll, we learn about concepts like velocity, momentum, force, and pressure. <br><br> <center><img src="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-ian_img01.png" style="border: none; width: 66%;" alt="image of introduction"></center><br> We realize we cannot outrun the troll nor defeat it by throwing rocks at it. However, we come up with a better strategy: we jump off a ledge, and when the troll follows, its stiff legs crack under its own weight. This is analogous to what happens in an egg drop.</details> |

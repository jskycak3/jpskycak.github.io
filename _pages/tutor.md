I've tutored hundreds of students for thousands of hours. Because I tailor each lesson to the learning style and personal interests of the student, my students not only excel in their classes and tests, but also understand and connect with the subject matter. For example:
<ul><li><font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-ian.pdf">Here</a></font> is a lesson I made for a student who was interested in <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Star Wars</i>, and needed to understand the math and physics behind an egg drop experiment.</li>  
<li><font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_primer.pdf">Here</a></font> is a primer I made which focuses on building intuition behind core concepts in calculus.</li>  
<li><font color="blue"><a href="https://jpskycak.github.io/files/jpskycak-calc_connections.pdf">Here</a></font> are some lessons I made to connect calculus to the real world -- not only science, technology, and engineering; but also history, philosophy, business, art, and athletics!</li></ul>

In addition to presenting the subject matter in an interesting way, I also maintain a comfortable learning environment where my students can learn to overcome problems without feeling embarrassed. My first part-time job was as a counselor at Children's Dispensary, a program for special-needs and undernourished kids, where I often had to calm children prone to explosive behavior (e.g. violence, screaming, running away) and assist those prone to hygiene issues.

I also offer enrichment for curious, advanced students who find joy in math.

 | <font color="green">Sufyan Z.</font> | Precalculus, AP Calculus AB/BC | When I took precalculus and Calculus AB, I really struggled. I had difficulty grasping concepts, whether it was either the difficulty of the class, the teacher and teaching method, or just really bad note-taking. I'd leave every calculus class in a state of confusion. That is, until I went and got tutored by Justin. Justin offers a great one-on-one tutoring experience, and I always knew that he could clear up any confusion from my lesson we learned that day. On homework, his expertise had no limit, remembering any methods and theorems like Newton's method or Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. If I couldn't understand a concept, he would write out an example, and explain it in a very comprehensible manner. I understood calculus thanks to Justin, something I wouldn't be able to do on my own. He's a great tutor, and I would highly recommend his services.  
 | <font color="green">Sara D.</font> | Calculus I/II | Justin clearly illustrates mathematical concepts while working through examples with his students. He is flexible and available, intelligent and understanding, and teaches new material by extending concepts and examples that are already familiar. Justin’s services helped me excel in calculus at the university level, and I would highly recommend his services to anyone struggling with math!   
 | <font color="green">Neal P.</font> | AP Calculus AB/BC | Justin was my math tutor for a year during the time I took AP calculus AB. I found the subject very hard even though I had lots of math background. Justin did a fantastic job of taking the complicated concepts I struggled with in calculus and made them simple. He used a lot of visual examples to help me not just understand the certain question I was doing, but also help me visualize the entire concept which in turn helped me do really well on the tests. Justin also was very focused even when I got frustrated, and he had many tricks up his sleeve to ensure that I knew what I was doing for the next test or homework assignment I had. He also kept it really fun during my tutoring sessions which made learning from him a completely enjoyable experience.
